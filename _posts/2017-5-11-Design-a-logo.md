The Enjade team is looking for a logo to represent the future of the Unity desktop, and we need your help! We want _you_ to design the next logo for Enjade!

<!--more-->

## Why a logo change?
The current Enjade logo is actually a temporary logo; near the completion of Enjade Core 0.1 and Enjade Pure 0.2, we will swap out any Ubuntu logos, in addition to the temporary logo, with the official Enjade logo.

## How do I contribute?
Making a submission is quite easy! Here's all you need to do:
* Design a logo in your favorite image editor
* Clone the Enjade website repository and edit the 'design-a-logo.md' file
* Add your logo to the logos folder, using the [Ubuntu Touch mask](https://samuelhewitt.com/images/ubuntu/ubuntu-shape.svg)
* Make a pull request for the site

## Requirements
Your logo should follow the following guidelines:
* be 512x512px in size, with the Ubuntu Touch mask applied
* remain simple; refrain from complex designs
* uniquely represent Enjade in some way

This section may get updated over time.

## Deadlines
Be sure to submit your logo by **October 2017**; we will vote on the logos in the following month and have changes made later.

Good luck, and have fun designing your icon!
