# Frequently Asked Questions
Over the course of the **Enjade Desktop** project, we've received an assortment of questions. Hopefully, this page will cover a majority of the common questions.

## What is Enjade?
Enjade is a desktop environment aimed at continuing the work of Unity 7, Canonical's own desktop environment before it was shut down on April 5, 2017.

## Is Enjade a Unity 7 fork?
No, Enjade isn't a Unity 7 fork, and there's good reason for it. The Unity desktop, in actuality, resides as a plugin for the compositing manager Compiz. Compiz hasn't seen updates, though projects like Compiz Reloaded and others have emerged. Sadly, it seems as if these technologies will not advance in the modern space; so, Enjade is made from scratch, with _Plasma_ as its base.

## Is Enjade supported by/worked on with Canonical?
Enjade remains a separate entity from Canonical, and there is no relation or affiliation with Canonical at the moment.

## Why does Enjade rely on KDE Plasma?
While creating a new desktop environment with GNOME as a backend would be ideal, it doesn't seem practical in today's share of desktop environments. MATE, Cinnamon, Budgie, etc., are all GNOME-based, which means that a plethora of GNOME-based desktops are readily available, in addition to the stock GNOME desktop that Ubuntu now ships with. However, not many Plasma-based environments exist; as such, Enjade works off of Plasma.

In addition to focusing on Plasma, Plasma's own widgets, plasmoids, themes, etc., include particular assets that could be vital to making Enjade a reality. The release of Plasma 5.9 saw the introduction of global menus in KDE, allowing menus to be centralized to a single panel. The customizability can be seen as **superior** to GNOME, making it a great choice for use as a desktop.

## Is Enjade a Plasma /fork/, or a /Look&Feel package/?
Enjade is available as a _Look&Feel package_, giving existing Plasma users an easy transition to the Enjade desktop. However, we do have plans to make an installable package via Snappy and/or Flatpak that bundles Plasma and Enjade together, with Enjade set as the default Look&Feel package for Plasma.

In addition to the Look&Feel package, some of the plasmoids, like the **Enjade Launcher (Chrysalis)**, are forks of some of the default KDE plasmoids. This brings overall familiarity while adding extensibility and customizability to these plasmoids. They are automatically bundled with the Look&Feel package, making installation easy.

## Will Enjade replicate Unity 7, or will it do more?
As of right now, the primary goal is to replicate the Unity 7 interface into Plasma almost identically. With the exception to theming, most of Enjade will look and feel similar to the latest Unity 7 package, Unity 7.4. This is to lay the foundation for what Enjade will build upon, so Enjade's development _doesn't end_ when the interface replication is complete.

## What will Enjade add next?
Once the interface replication is complete, new features and improvements will be added to make it even more useful and powerful, while providing a familiar look.

We cover these feature additions in a roadmap on our wiki, [which you can find here](http://www.github.com/enjade-project/enjade/wiki/Feature-Roadmap).

## Is Enjade associated with Acquainted Safari?
If you are unfamiliar with Acquainted Safari, [Acquainted Safari](http://www.acquaintedsafari.ga) is a community centered around creating content of multiple types, from eBooks to apps and services.

While Acquainted Safari plans to use Enjade as the default desktop environment in their operating platform, [VivaOS](http://viva.acquaintedsafari.ga), there are no associations between Acquainted Safari and the Enjade community.

> "Yes, I do run Acquainted Safari and am a part of Enjade, but these are separate entities; I never intended for these entities to collide with each other as a single entity, but as a connection between two communities." - Marquis Kurt  

## Where did the name Enjade come from, and how do you pronounce it?
Enjade is pronounced like you would expect: **enh - jayd**. This isn't to be confused with a word of similar spelling.

"Enjade" was inspired by a potential partner and community member of Acquainted Safari: [Jaeden Gurrero](http://www.instagram.com/jaenoelani). Essentially, the syllables in her name swapped, hence the pronunciation of the name. If you want to look at this symbolically, she could easily represent Caroline from the game _Portal 2_, the successor to Cave Johnson, much like how Enjade is the successor to Unity 7.

## Free hugs?
We could try, but we don't know how to make a plasmoid for that. :/
