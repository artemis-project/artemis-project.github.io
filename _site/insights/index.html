        <p><p>When I first started the Enjade project, I wanted to give a name that best represented the clean, friendly nature of the Unity desktop while presenting something completely new. Sadly, things have changed and not everything is what it seems.</p>

        <h4>New site, changed views, and a brighter future</h4>
        <h6>Written by: Marquis Kurt, 7 May 17</h6>
        <p><p>When I first started this project back in April, I had no clue as to how the entire project would play out. I thought that I would be by myself on it, having to create and maintain an entire environment with little to no help. After all, I do see comments regularly that show that users’ disliking of the Unity desktop project. To my surprise, I was wrong; currently, there are ~30 members in the Telegram group for the Enjade Project, some base ideas for how the entire project will roll out, and an article on OMG! Ubuntu featuring the project.</p>
