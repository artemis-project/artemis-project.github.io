It was a close battle between several names, but the decision has been made‚Ä¶ by you, the community!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/name-survey-distribution.png&quot; alt=&quot;Distribution&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;interesting-results-runners-up&quot;&gt;Interesting results: Runners-up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the five days, we received a total of &lt;em&gt;75&lt;/em&gt; responses from all over the world.It was amazing looking at each and every individual vote, seeing the overall distribution of the possible names for the project. To remind you, we had the following choices: Artemis, Chrysalis, Desiree, Cambria, Ka‚Äôiulani, ‚ÄòOther‚Äô, and a combo of the aforementioned names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of people had some interesting names in the ‚ÄòOther‚Äô section, including (but not limited to):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My ass (my personal favorite üòÇ )&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New Unity Desktop Environment (NUDE)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;GNUDE&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Junity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;commUnity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, the fight between &lt;em&gt;Desiree&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Chrysalis&lt;/em&gt; ensued, crushing Cambria and Ka‚Äôiulani. I can assure you that some of our services and tools for the desktop project will have these names because of their little skirmish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;drumroll-please&quot;&gt;Drumroll, please!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moment you‚Äôve been waiting for is here!
¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;¬†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-new-name-for-the-enjade-project-is-artemis&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new name for the Enjade Project is‚Ä¶ Artemis!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I heavily thanks the community for their input on the new name for this beloved project, and I can‚Äôt wait to see what the next survey will hold! There‚Äôs a few things I want to make sure you all know before we get underway with this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The next survey will be about theming and Artemis‚Äôs official logo, used for the Dash icon. Please, go to the ‚ÄòGet Involved‚Äô page, join the Telegram group, and submit your logos there!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For now, the GitHub Pages, repo, and Telegram URLs will continue to be labeled as ‚ÄúEnjade Project‚Äù. This will get fixed eventually when we get a new URL and find a way to block ‚ÄòEnjade‚Äô as the name of the entire project out of our heads.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;With that in mind, the ‚ÄòEnjade‚Äô name will stay, probably for an API or something like that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks, folks, for your suggestions! We‚Äôre making progress with Artemis, and we‚Äôre excited to release something soon.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Marquis Kurt</name></author><summary type="html">After a successful five days of voting, I am pleased to introduce the new name for the Enjade Project.

Sadly, things have changed and not everything is what it seems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-happened&quot;&gt;What happened?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won‚Äôt go into details as to what exactly prompted this decision to rename the project, but I have come to the realization that the person we named the project after doesn‚Äôt best reflect the values and mission of the desktop project. I was quite shocked when I realized this as nothing negative happened for the past two months; however, things gave way and I had to go for the renaming. As much as I love the cool name of ‚ÄúEnjade‚Äù, it‚Äôll keep haunting everyone of the failure of finding Amour Sans for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.acquaintedsafari.ga&quot;&gt;A.Safari&lt;/a&gt;. I had the impression that, in properly naming the project to &lt;em&gt;Enjade&lt;/em&gt;, I would clearly express the openness and the friendliness of the Unity desktop that Canonical had worked on since Ubuntu 11.04 and that the person Enjade was named after would feel proud (adn flattered, I supposed), to have an entire project that resounds with such a friendly personality and may be moved to join the project. I was wrong on both counts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-will-happen-now&quot;&gt;What will happen now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The continuation of the Unity desktop will still happen, and there will still be Core and Pure. This won‚Äôt change as the desktop environment is what started the project in the first place; I don‚Äôt want to shut down a growing, loving community working on a beautiful, open, and friendly desktop. However, we‚Äôll need you help to not make the same mistake. We have a survey to discuss possible names; please, take the time to fill out this survey. This will help rebrand the project to something that is more reflective of the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/forms/OUSwuDEsRHiT0Y9N2&quot;&gt;Take the survey ‚Ä∫&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for taking the time to read this and help make the project even better. To give you some hope, I am excited to tell you that we are in the process of renaming the Pure code right now and are on track to making a build in the forseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Marquis Kurt</name></author><summary type="html">When I first started the Enjade project, I wanted to give a name that best represented the clean, friendly nature of the Unity desktop while presenting something completely new.

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-a-logo-change&quot;&gt;Why a logo change?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current Enjade logo is actually a temporary logo; near the completion of Enjade Core 0.1 and Enjade Pure 0.2, we will swap out any Ubuntu logos, in addition to the temporary logo, with the official Enjade logo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-do-i-contribute&quot;&gt;How do I contribute?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making a submission is quite easy! Here‚Äôs all you need to do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Design a logo in your favorite image editor&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clone the Enjade website repository and edit the ‚Äòdesign-a-logo.md‚Äô file&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add your logo to the logos folder, using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://samuelhewitt.com/images/ubuntu/ubuntu-shape.svg&quot;&gt;Ubuntu Touch mask&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make a pull request for the site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;requirements&quot;&gt;Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your logo should follow the following guidelines:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;be 512x512px in size, with the Ubuntu Touch mask applied&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;remain simple; refrain from complex designs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;uniquely represent Enjade in some way&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section may get updated over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;deadlines&quot;&gt;Deadlines&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be sure to submit your logo by &lt;strong&gt;October 2017&lt;/strong&gt;; we will vote on the logos in the following month and have changes made later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck, and have fun designing your icon!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Marquis Kurt</name></author><summary type="html">The Enjade team is looking for a logo to represent the future of the Unity desktop, and we need your help!

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;enjade-is-growing&quot;&gt;Enjade is growing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Enjade Project has been accelerating at such a great speed. We‚Äôve created a decent roadmap for what features we plan to implement in the desktop environment. We‚Äôve already begun discussing new Plasmoids to introduce to the Plasma environment to bring about the new Unity, such as the Enjade Launcher. Now, we have a decent-looking website with Ubuntu‚Äôs freely-avaialable CSS, adding a cohesive Unity feel rather than a simple one-page solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm excited to see the future of Enjade unfold; it seems as if I have made a good investment in resurrecting the Unity desktop in such a way that will combine the core of the environment while including progression of modern Linux technologies like Wayland. I am also anticipating how Enjade will become more than just a Unity replica; I‚Äôm overseeing the future of the Unity desktop through Enjade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introducing-enjade-core-and-enjade-pure&quot;&gt;Introducing Enjade Core and Enjade Pure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I‚Äôm pleased to announce that ther will be two versions of the Enjade desktop for Linux users. The first is the Enjade desktop you are already familiar with with a Plasma-based environment: Enjade Core. Enjade Core will be the first to get new features and innovations in the acclaimed environment. In addition to this, we will ship a version of Ubuntu LTS with this desktop pre-installed, making it easy for transition. This distribution is not the same distribution as &lt;a href=&quot;http://viva.acquaintedsafari.ga&quot;&gt;VivaOS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other version of Enjade is one that should have already existed (but didn‚Äôt). For many, users don‚Äôt really notice or expect the latest and greatest innovations; in fact, there are users who still prefer X11 and Compiz over Wayland, and that‚Äôs understandable. So, today, I‚Äôm pleased to introduce a new version of the Enjade Project that continues the direct work of the Unity desktop: Enjade Pure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-enjade-pure&quot;&gt;Why Enjade Pure?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjade Pure is a direct fork of the Unity 7 desktop environment, unlike Enjade Core, considered a ‚Äúpseudo-fork‚Äù. Enjade Pure retains the core essence and overall functionality of the Unity 7 desktop, but will get the features from Enjade Core. We‚Äôre also planning to ship a distribution of Ubuntu (regular release) with Enjade Pure. Enjade Pure will receive features after they‚Äôve been implemented in Enjade Core.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Retaining the original Unity desktop while pumping in new features can make it easy for a user to transition to another desktop, especially if that user doesn‚Äôt care about using the latest and greatest software. As Enjade Core is a fledgling desktop environment, Enjade Pure offers a reliable and well-built environment, based off of the original Unity. In addition to this, Compiz Reloaded continues the work of Compiz, so it may be possible that Enjade Pure can continue to exist in modern ways. It could also be possible that Enjade Pure will work off of Mutter, continuing the beloved desktop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider this a birthday gift, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.instagram.com/jaenoelani&quot;&gt;@Jaeden Gurrero&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-clearer-feature-roadmap&quot;&gt;A clearer feature roadmap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of this, a new feature roadmap will be implemented that covers the general timeframe of Enjade‚Äôs releases and implementations. The new roadmap will be hosted on this site and can be found by clicking ‚ÄúFeatures‚Äù in the navigation bar of the main site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for being a part of this community, and I can‚Äôt wait to see what‚Äôs next with Enjade.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Marquis Kurt</name></author><summary type="html">When I first started this project back in April, I had no clue as to how the entire project would play out.
