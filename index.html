        If you are looking for the Artemis Project, the Unity desktop
        continuation announced in 2017 in response to the deprecation of Unity
        in favor of GNOME 3 in Ubuntu, congratulations; you've reached the
        official website. However, as of July 17, 2020, the project is no longer
        being maintained.
      </p>

        When I first started working on Artemis, I didn't know exactly what I
        was getting into, and I didn't necessarily have the best skills in
        running a mass-scale project like this. Rather than having something to
        work with and building my way up, I attempted to work top-down, which
        led to a gradual declining interest and motivation in the project. I
        take full responsibility for not giving this project the proper
        attention it deserved.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suffice to say, I am no longer maintaining or leading this project. It
        was a fun run while it lasted, and I appreciate the community that
        formed around it. If you're still looking for a Unity continuation, I
        recommend checking out the work being done by UBPorts. If you want to
        still work with me on other projects, I am currently working on
        <a href="https://hyperspace.marquiskurt.net">Hyperspace</a> and a few
        other things on GitHub.
