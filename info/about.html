    <h2>enjade /ɛn - 'jeɪd/*</h2>
    <p>
        The word <i>enjade</i> came about as a result of <a>Acquainted Safari's</a> potential<sup>ℨ</sup> partnership with <a href = "http://www.instagram.com/jaenoelani">Jaeden Gurrero</a>. Essentially, the pronunciation of the syllables have been swapped, creating a unique word that represents the spirit of continuing the venerable Unity desktop.
    </p>
    <p>
        While her personality does match up with the spirit and community formed to continue Unity, she is not affiliated with this project by any means.

    <p class = "note">
        *&nbsp;This pronunciation key uses the <a href = "http://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/us/about/pronunciation_american_english">Oxford dictionary syntax</a>.
    </p>
    <p class = "note">
        <sup>✝</sup>&nbsp;Enjade is not to be confused with the Malay word "enjade", meaning "get".
