## Is Enjade supported by/worked on with Canonical?
Enjade remains a separate entity from Canonical, and there is no relation or affiliation with Canonical at the moment.

## Is Enjade associated with Acquainted Safari?
If you are unfamiliar with Acquainted Safari, [Acquainted Safari](http://www.acquaintedsafari.ga) is a community centered around creating content of multiple types, from eBooks to apps and services.

> "Yes, I do run Acquainted Safari and am a part of Enjade, but these are separate entities; I never intended for these entities to collide with each other as a single entity, but as a connection between two communities." - Marquis Kurt 

&nbsp;

While Acquainted Safari plans to use Enjade as the default desktop environment in their operating platform, [VivaOS](http://viva.acquaintedsafari.ga), there are no associations between Acquainted Safari and the Enjade community.
